# Binance-trading-bot

It is a bot to trade cryptocurrency in Binance. The algorithm is based on the short script and tutorial provided in https://github.com/hackingthemarkets. Additionally, I added bayesian optimization to find the RSI parameters every 4 hours based on the up-to-date data. It is still a working project.

The main script is 'tony.py'.
